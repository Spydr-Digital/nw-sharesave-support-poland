# Important information

We wrote this content as a guide to your choices at the end of your ShareSave plan. It’s not a comprehensive guide to all of the plan rules.

Your participation, or right to participate, in the plan is governed by these rules and doesn’t affect, or form part of, your contract of employment. The rules include specific provisions limiting your rights under the plan.

You have no right to compensation or damages for any loss of rights, benefits, or prospective benefits under the plan if your employment is terminated. There is no guarantee that we’ll offer a ShareSave plan every year, or that if we do offer one, you’ll be able to take part.

We may amend, suspend, or terminate all or part of a plan at any time, but only in accordance with the plan’s rules.

Where we’ve talked about tax, we’ve based this on the rates and rules at the time. These are for guidance only and can change in the future. Any tax you need to pay will depend on your own individual circumstances.

In the case of any conflict between this content and the rules of the plan, the rules apply.

Further information on NatWest Group and details of the rights attached to the shares can be found in the Investor relations section of our website. Certain information is provided in this document in order for this offer and any subsequent admission of shares to trading to fall within Article 1(4)(i) and 1(5)(h) of the UK Prospectus Regulation which exempt NatWest Group from producing a prospectus under that directive.

If you pay tax in the US, you should bear in mind that you might need to pay tax under the ‘deferred compensation' rules. US taxpayers are strongly advised to seek their own tax advice from an independent US tax adviser before they decide to participate in ShareSave.

We wrote the content on this site to help you make your choice, but it’s not advice, or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold NatWest shares.

The value of shares can fall as well as rise, so you could get back less than you invest. Dividends aren’t guaranteed.

If you’re not sure what to do, or have any doubts about your tax position, we suggest you speak to a financial adviser.
