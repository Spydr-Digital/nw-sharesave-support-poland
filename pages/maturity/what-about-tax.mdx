# What about tax?

There’s no tax payable when you use your ShareSave option and savings to buy shares.

If you sell your shares and make a profit, you’ll need to pay capital gains tax at the current rate of 19%. This will be payable by 30 April of the year following the year you sell your shares, and you’ll be responsible for declaring this income in your annual tax return (PIT-38) as it won’t be included in your PIT-11 form.

There are no social security or health insurance contributions due.

Any income from ShareSave counts towards the 1,000,000 PLN threshold for the solidarity tax.
