# What about tax?

There’s no tax payable when you use your ShareSave option and savings to buy shares.

If you decide to sell your shares and you make a profit, capital gains tax is payable on the difference between the option price and the sale price of your shares. The current rate of CGT is 19%. The tax is payable by 30 April of the year following the year you sell your shares, and you’ll need to declare this income in your annual tax return (PIT-38) as it won’t be included in your PIT-11 form.

There are no social security or health insurance contributions due.

Any income from ShareSave counts towards the 1,000,000 PLN threshold for solidarity tax.

If you decide to keep your shares, you’ll be entitled to receive any future dividends paid on those shares. You’ll receive a dividend confirmation statement on EquatePlus which will provide details of your dividend. You can use this information to declare the dividend on your annual personal tax return and subsequently pay any dividend tax due.
