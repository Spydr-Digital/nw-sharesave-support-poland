# Do I need any permission or pre-approval to make my choice?

Buying shares:
You don’t usually need permission or pre-approval to buy shares at the end of ShareSave, provided you don’t sell them straight away. 
If you’re an insider, you can’t do this in the 30 days before we announce annual or half-year results to the market.

Selling shares:
Any share sales are subject to the Personal Account Dealing policy - you’ll find the rules on the intranet.

If you’re an insider or work in a defined business area, you’ll need to get prior authorisation if you want to sell shares outside a prohibited period.
