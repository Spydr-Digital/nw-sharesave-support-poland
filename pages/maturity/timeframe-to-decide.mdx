# How long do I have to decide?

You’ve got six months from your maturity date to decide what to do. The expiry date is the last day you can choose to buy shares at the option price. After this you’ll still be able to have your savings returned to you as cash. This won’t happen automatically – you’ll need to log in to your EquatePlus account.
