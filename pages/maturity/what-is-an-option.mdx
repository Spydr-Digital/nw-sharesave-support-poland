# What is an option?

Your ShareSave option is your opportunity to buy a set number of NatWest shares when the plan end. The price you’ll pay is the option price. 

If the NatWest share price is higher than the option price, you can choose to buy the shares (known as ‘exercising your option’), and you’ll make a profit. 

If the share price is lower than the option price you can choose not to exercise your option and instead take your savings back as cash.
