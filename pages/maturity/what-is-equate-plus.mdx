# What is the Equate Plus online account

If you decide to buy shares and you don’t want to sell them straight away, your shares will be held in an online account with EquatePlus. The shares are held electronically instead of you holding a share certificate.

You can see your shares, buy, or sell by logging in. It’s free to hold shares in the account. When you buy or sell, you’ll pay a dealing charge of 0.235% (minimum of £17).

As a shareholder you’ll receive any dividends directly into your EquatePlus account, and can vote at our Annual General Meeting. You can also choose to have your dividends automatically reinvested in more shares if you wish.

Full details of how to use the account can be found on [EquatePlus](https://www.equateplus.com/).
