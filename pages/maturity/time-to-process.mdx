# How long will it take for my instruction to be processed?

We process Polish ShareSave instructions weekly, on a date we call the ‘allotment date’. To have your instruction processed on the next allotment date, you’ll need to submit it by the cut-off date.

In the usual weekly process, the cut-off date is Friday each week at 11pm (UK time) and the allotment date is Thursday each week. The timings are subject to change when there are bank holidays.

How long your instruction takes to be processed after the allotment date depends on what choice you have made.

If you choose to buy shares and keep them, they’ll usually be in your EquatePlus account within 2 working days.
If you choose to buy shares and sell all of them straight away, your money will be sent to you two days after you sell. Remember it can take up to 5 days for the money to reach your bank account (longer for international transactions) and during the festive season this can take longer than usual.
If you choose to take your savings back as cash, the money will be returned to you in your pay in the next available Payroll.
