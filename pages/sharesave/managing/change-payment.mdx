# Can I change or stop my payment?

You can’t change your amount during the plan.

If you want to stop saving and cancel the plan you can do this and have all your money returned. You can do this via EquatePlus or by calling +44 (0)370 702 0109. If you cancel after that month’s payroll cut-off date, the payment will be taken and returned to you the following month.

If you’ve made 12 or more monthly payments, and you want to stop saving, you can keep what you’ve saved so far in the plan and use it to buy shares at the end.
