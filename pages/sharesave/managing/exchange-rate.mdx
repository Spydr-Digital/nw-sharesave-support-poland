# How do movements in the exchange rate affect me?

If you're already in ShareSave, your savings are in Polish Zloty, but the shares are priced in British pounds.

If you choose to buy NatWest shares when the plan ends, your savings will be converted into pounds at that point, using the exchange rate at the time.

If the zloty is worth more against the pound when the plan ends, you’ll be able to buy the full number of shares.

If the zloty is worth less against the pound, you won’t be able to buy the full number of shares. You can’t make up the shortfall by adding extra zloty to your savings.
