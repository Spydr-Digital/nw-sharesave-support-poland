# I leave NatWest?

If you leave because you’re made redundant, retire, or through injury or disability, or the company you’re employed by is no longer part of NatWest, you can choose to:

* Use the amount you’ve already saved to buy shares at the option price within six months of leaving.
* Have your savings returned to you straight away.

If you resign or you’re dismissed, you won’t be able to buy shares and you’ll get your savings back as cash.
