# I move to work for NatWest in another country?

If you move to another part of NatWest in a different country, you’ll have to stop saving into ShareSave. If you’ve been saving for at least 12 months, you’ll be able to use your savings to buy NatWest shares at the end of the plan – or get your money back if you prefer.

If you’ve been saving for less than 12 months, you’ll get your savings returned as cash.
