# I’m on long-term leave (e.g. maternity, paternity, adoption, partner) or long-term sick leave?

If you’re on long-term leave, you can still join ShareSave. If you’re not being paid at the moment, you can still join, but your monthly payments won’t start until you’re back at work and being paid. The plan will still end in three or five years’ time, so you’ll make fewer payments and be able to buy a smaller number of shares at the end.

If you joined ShareSave before you went on leave, and you’re still being paid via payroll, we’ll still take your payment. If you’re not being paid, or your pay isn’t enough to cover your monthly amount, your savings will be paused. They’ll restart again when you start work, provided the plan hasn’t ended.

In all cases you’ll need to have made at least 12 monthly payments to be able to buy shares at the end of the plan.
