# I die?

If you die, your savings will automatically stop. 

Your personal representative can choose to either have your savings returned to your estate, or use them to buy shares at the option price.

If you die before the plan finishes, they’ll have one year after your death to choose to buy the shares. If you die in the six months after the plan finishes, they’ll have a year from when the plan finished.
