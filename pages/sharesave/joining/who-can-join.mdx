Unfortunately, we're no longer able to offer new ShareSave plans to colleagues in Poland. 
Each year we have to make a decision on offering ShareSave and how it will work for the savings period. ShareSave is a longer-term savings plan, usually 3-5 years and for this reason opening a new ShareSave plan is not compatible with the closure of the Poland hub.
