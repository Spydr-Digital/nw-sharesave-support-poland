# If I can't join a new plan, what about the plans I am already in?

If you’re already in a plan, there’s no change to your existing ShareSave plans. We’ll keep taking your monthly amount from your salary. If you stay in ShareSave until the end of your savings period and you’re still employed by NatWest, or you leave before the end of the savings period due to redundancy, you’ll be able to choose to buy shares or take your savings back in cash.
