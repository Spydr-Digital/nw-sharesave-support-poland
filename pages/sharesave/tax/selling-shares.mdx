# Selling shares

There are no tax or social security obligations when you join the plan, when the plan ends, or when you buy shares through the plan. 

If you sell your shares and make a profit, youâ€™ll need to pay capital gains tax at the current rate of 19%. There are no social security or health insurance contributions due.

Any income from ShareSave counts towards the 1,000,000 PLN threshold for the solidarity tax.
