# How do movements in the exchange rate affect me?

If you join ShareSave, your savings will be in Indian rupees, but the shares are priced in British pounds. 

If you choose to buy NatWest shares when the plan ends, your savings will be converted into pounds at that point, using the exchange rate at the time.

If the rupee is worth more against the pound when the plan ends, you’ll be able to buy the full number of shares, and any extra cash will be returned to you.

If the rupee is worth less against the pound, you won’t be able to buy the full number of shares. You can’t make up the shortfall by adding extra rupees to your savings.
