# Buying shares

If you choose to buy shares when the plan ends, you’ll need to pay income tax on the difference between the price you pay (the option price) and the market price on the day you buy them. You won’t pay employee or employer social security. NatWest will deduct the tax for you and pay it to the government. 

We’ll send you a Form 16 and Form 12BA by 15 June the following year to show you’ve paid the tax.
