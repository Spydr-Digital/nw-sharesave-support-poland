# How will I know what my new monthly savings amount is going to be?

We’ve sent you an email to let you know what your new monthly savings amount is. You’ll be able to see number of shares you’ll able to buy when the scheme finishes on your EquatePlus account.

You’ll also be able to see your monthly savings amount on your December payslip.
