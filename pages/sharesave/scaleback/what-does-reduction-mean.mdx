# What does this reduction mean for me?

For all colleagues, apart from those saving the minimum monthly amount, monthly savings amounts will be reduced by around 8.5%. This means that your monthly savings amount will be reduced by this percentage, and this will also reduce the number of shares you’ll be able to buy when the scheme finishes.

Colleagues saving the minimum monthly amount (£5 (UK), 500 INR (India) and 25 PLN (Poland)) will not be subject to a reduction.  This is because there is a minimum level of contribution required in order to be able to participate in the scheme.  Applying the reduction to colleagues saving the minimum amount would effectively remove them from the scheme.
