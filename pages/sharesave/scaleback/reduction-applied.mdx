# Why has a reduction been applied to my ShareSave 2023 monthly savings amount?

A record number of colleagues applied to join ShareSave this year. To make sure that everyone who wants to join can do so, weâ€™ve been able to make more shares available. However due to the popularity of ShareSave with colleagues, we need to reduce the number of shares each colleague can receive. This means we need to reduce the amount colleagues have asked to save each month.
