# Why has the total number of shares available under ShareSave 2023 been restricted?

Before making a ShareSave offer, we have to consider the commitments we have given to shareholders concerning the number of shares which we may issue under our colleague share plans.

The making of a ShareSave offer represents a significant cost to us and our shareholders. Each year a careful review of our commitments must be undertaken before any decision is made on whether a ShareSave offer can be made and, if so, the number of shares that can be made available.

We have increased the number of shares originally allocated to the ShareSave 2023 offer. By making more shares available, we have tried to minimise the impact on monthly savings while balancing the interests of all colleagues.
